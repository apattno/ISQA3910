##Executive Summary

The repository on GitHub is centered around the Data Flow Diagram (DFD). This DFD shows a simple level 0 diagram that shows the relationship between the internal and external coorporation. The external entities are a developer and his manager. The overall project will allow for several things. These items are more completely explained when looking at the DFD and reading the dictionary in this repository.
This process will allow a developer to have a single process that will send the software to be scanned for license information and check it against the NIST database for known vulnerabilities.  After the developer gets the results of these scans he can request Policy documents from the policy DB
On the onther end of the DFD is the manager. He can also request the results of the liscense and vulnerabilities scan. He can also make changes to the policy documents by adding new or modifying existing.
Although the overall process may seem very simpole it actually gets a lot of work done.
